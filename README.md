# PlatformerTutorial
 
This is a very basic platformer template for me to work from.

This mostly follows a youtube tutorial to get the basic functionality in.

Fmod has been implemented on a basic level just to know it will work in Godot. 
Currently main menu music plays with the Top Menu and Sub Level layers switching when the player jumps.
